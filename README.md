# Introduction

Ecman is a simple game where the goal is to navigate through the maze using Emacs keybindings.
Each level will get more difficult and requires player to use more effective keybindings. For example, instead of running forward by pressing down ``C-f`` player will learn to jump around with ``M-f`` etc. New combinations and keybindings can be unlocked by picking up points or badges on the way.The score for each level will be calculated based on number of keystrokes player used, points collected etc.

# How to start

Run `boot dev` inside the cloned ecman project and navigate to `localhost:3000`
